## Project Overview

The Relational Database Administration Capstone Project focuses on:

- **Designing** efficient OLTP and Data Warehouse systems.
- **Securing** databases through encryption and access controls.
- **Optimizing** performance for better query response times.
- **Automating** workflows using Apache Airflow.

This project serves as a comprehensive guide for database administrators, developers, and anyone interested in mastering relational database systems.

## Technologies Used

- **MySQL**: A widely-used relational database management system.
- **PostgreSQL**: An advanced, open-source relational database.
- **Apache Airflow**: A platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.
- **Shell Scripting**: For automating repetitive tasks and managing system operations.

## Features

- **OLTP and Data Warehouse Design**: Create efficient and scalable database architectures.
- **Database Security**: Implement encryption and secure access protocols.
- **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune databases for faster queries and better resource management.
- **Data Pipelines**: Build and manage ETL processes with Apache Airflow.
- **Backup and Restore**: Ensure data integrity with reliable backup solutions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chirpparasan/Relational-Database-Administration-Capstone-Project.git
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- MySQL or PostgreSQL
- Apache Airflow
- Python (for scripting)
- Shell environment (Linux or macOS)

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Install MySQL or PostgreSQL**: Follow the official documentation for installation.
2. **Install Apache Airflow**: Use the command below to install Airflow.

   ```bash
   pip install apache-airflow
   ```

3. **Clone the repository**: As mentioned above.

4. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Relational-Database-Administration-Capstone-Project
   ```

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can start using the scripts and workflows provided in this repository. 

1. **Run SQL scripts**: Navigate to the SQL directory and execute scripts using your database client.
2. **Execute Airflow DAGs**: Start the Airflow scheduler and web server to manage your data pipelines.

## Data Pipelines

The project includes various data pipelines built with Apache Airflow. Each pipeline is designed to handle ETL processes efficiently.

- **DAGs**: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) represent the workflow.
- **Operators**: Use different operators for tasks such as data extraction, transformation, and loading.

For detailed instructions on how to set up and run the pipelines, refer to the `airflow` directory in the project.

## Backup and Restore

Data integrity is crucial. This project provides scripts for backing up and restoring databases.

### Backup

To create a backup, run the following command:

```bash
./backup.sh
```

### Restore

To restore from a backup, use:

```bash
./restore.sh
```

Ensure you have the necessary permissions and configurations in place.

## Database Security

Security is a top priority. This project implements various security measures:

- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access controls are enforced to limit database access.

### Implementing Security Measures

To implement security measures, follow these steps:

1. **Set up SSL for database connections**.
2. **Use strong passwords and regular audits**.
3. **Monitor access logs for suspicious activities**.
